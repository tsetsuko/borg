# Workflow

How the operator and Claude actually run sprints on borg. Read this after CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md when you (Claude) come back from a context compaction.

CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md tell you what NOT to do in the codebase (scope, guardrails, taste). This file tells you what TO do in the dev loop.

## LIVE SYSTEM -- reset is allowed after a backup (as of 2026-06-04)

Borg holds real memory (the AI being in the BotArena arena, on `demo/server/.borg-data/demo`). It is valuable but **not sacred**: a data reset is allowed as long as you back up first. The 2026-05-31 "NEVER RESET" regime is **lifted** -- it was over-strict for an experimental system, and resetting genuinely simplifies schema/data work.

The rules that now apply:

- **Back up before resetting, and verify the backup.** Recipe:

  ```bash
  TS=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
  cp -a demo/server/.borg-data/demo "$HOME/borg-demo-backups/demo-$TS"
  # plus a consistent snapshot of the live SQLite DB:
  sqlite3 "file:demo/server/.borg-data/demo/borg.db?mode=ro" \
    ".backup '$HOME/borg-demo-backups/demo-$TS/borg.db-clean'"
  sqlite3 "$HOME/borg-demo-backups/demo-$TS/borg.db-clean" "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
  ```

- **Reset is allowed.** `/api/admin/reset` (confirm token `RESET`), or stop the demo server and wipe `.borg-data/demo`, then let it reopen clean. Restarting the *process* preserves the DB; a *data* reset needs only a prior verified backup.
- **Schema changes: forward-migrate OR edit-baseline-and-reset.** Both are fine. Use a forward migration when you want to keep accumulated memory; otherwise back up, edit the baseline, and reset + reseed. You are not locked into data-preserving migrations.
- **Between resets, on-disk shapes are still contracts.** If you are NOT resetting, a stored-shape change still needs a migration that preserves existing data.

### History

Earlier, borg had no real data and the rule was "edit the baseline in place, then reset." When the being went live (2026-05-31) that was replaced by a strict NEVER-RESET regime. As of 2026-06-04 the strict regime is **lifted**: reset is allowed again, gated only on a verified backup. "Edit the baseline + reset" is a legitimate path once more -- just back up first. Older commit messages referencing either regime still make sense in their own time.

## Project goal (the only one that matters)

A cognitive memory architecture for an LLM that is:

1. **Generic** -- works across group chats, single-user dev, relationship stuff, and other similar use cases. Not overfit to one scenario. Cross-audience recall is global for cognition; disclosure is contextual and handled after recall. See `BOUNDARIES.md` as the source of truth for recall/disclosure boundaries.
2. **Clean code** -- no overengineering, no duplication, no dead paths, well organized.
3. **Simple flow** -- minimal paths. Every additional check or branch must be worth the complexity it adds. If you can't defend it, delete it.

Behavioral correctness across the sim suite looked good as of v83.1, but that is no longer the headline. The durable memory-architecture doctrine is global internal recall with disclosure labels: the being remembers broadly, the harness labels origin/privacy/trust/disclosure constraints, and the being decides what to say within those constraints. `BOUNDARIES.md` is the source of truth for the implemented recall/disclosure boundary; do not reintroduce audience/session recall gates in cognition.

**Stop at diminishing returns.** These signs apply to incremental quality work after the recall/disclosure boundary in `BOUNDARIES.md` remains intact:

- Each sprint produces only minor refinements.
- New mechanisms gate on questionable hypotheticals or rare edge cases.
- GPT review surfaces "nice to have" not "broken".
- You're proposing observability layers on observability layers.
- Coverage pressure exceeds correctness pressure.

When you notice these, raise it with the operator and stop the cycle.

## The standard sprint cycle

The operator runs this with a GPT Pro Extended reviewer (ChatGPT in Chromium) as the architectural second opinion. Claude drives codex, sims, commits, and the submission.

```
GPT review arrives in chat
  ↓
1.  Cross-verify reviewer claims with codex (don't trust blindly)
  ↓
2.  Triage by severity: P0 / P1 / P2. Pause at P3 for the operator.
  ↓
3.  For each priority, separate committable sprint:
      a. codex exploration (find existing utilities, peer files)
      b. codex implementation (require search-before-create)
      c. codex review of the diff
      d. fix CRITICAL / IMPORTANT only -- filter MINOR / SUGGESTION
      e. run tests + tsc + lint
      f. commit (single sprint = single commit; co-author Claude)
  ↓
4.  Run validation sims in parallel:
      family-aging-parent + shared-state-compaction
  ↓
5.  Draft `~/borg-v[N]-review-questions.md`:
      - cross-verification table (CONFIRMED / PARTIAL / REFUTED)
      - commit summaries
      - sim headlines comparing v[N-1] → v[N]
      - 5-10 questions for the reviewer
      - production-policing boundary status
  ↓
6.  Zip the project, submit, poll, ingest response.
  ↓
Loop.
```

Stop and discuss with the operator when:
- The reviewer claims something you can't reproduce in codex cross-verification.
- A proposed sprint fails the Opus 5.0 test (see CLAUDE.md).
- You're tempted to add an in-flight LLM judge of semantic output (see CLAUDE.md production-policing section).
- The sprint plan crosses P3.

---

## Pushback principles

GPT Pro Extended is a strong reviewer but not infallible. Filter every recommendation:

- **Opus 5.0 test** -- mandatory before any harness work. See CLAUDE.md.
- **Production-policing boundary** -- never add in-flight LLM/regex judges of non-critical semantic output. See CLAUDE.md.
- **Code hygiene rules** -- grep before adding a helper; extract repeated values; mimic existing patterns; read a peer file first. See user CLAUDE.md.
- **Defend sound positions** -- if the operator or the reviewer push back on a recommendation that was actually right, explain the trade-off rather than folding.
- **Honest negative findings** -- if a sim shows nothing changed, say so. Don't dress it up.

When you decline a recommendation, say why and offer the counter.

## Test execution is manual by design

There is deliberately no CI vitest job and no git hook running the suite (Tom's
explicit decision, 2026-08-26). Sessions run `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm test` +
`pnpm heuristics:guard` themselves before merging or deploying. Do not escalate
the absence of an automatic test runner as a finding; it is a settled policy,
not an oversight.

## ChatGPT submission mechanics

(As of 2026-05-24. Chromium on luth's headless sway session at :5901. May drift if ChatGPT redesigns.)

**Start a fresh thread each cycle.** ChatGPT threads get unwieldy after many turns (the "Project Analysis and Review" thread was used from ~v70 through v83 and got very long). Click the "new chat" pencil icon at top-left of the sidebar, then **verify the model picker shows `Pro · Extended`** (bottom-right of the composer). The dropdown lists `Latest · 5.5`, `Instant`, `Thinking · Heavy`, `Pro · Extended`, `Configure...`. **`Heavy` is NOT Pro** -- it's GPT-5.5 with heavy thinking effort. The Pro Extended model is its own entry below. Each review cycle is self-contained -- the zip + questions doc give GPT everything it needs.

### 1. Zip the project

The canonical recipe builds the file list from `git ls-files` plus explicit additions, then zips from stdin:

```bash
cd /home/luth/Programming && rm -f ~/borgvN.zip && \
  { git -C borg ls-files | sed 's|^|borg/|'; \
    find borg/.git borg/.design-dump borg/simulator-runs -type f 2>/dev/null; \
  } | sort -u | zip ~/borgvN.zip -@
```

Why this shape: the simple `zip -r borg/ -x '*/node_modules/*'` recipe blows up on pnpm's symlink-heavy `node_modules/.pnpm/` layout once the demo workspace (with multiple nested `node_modules/`) is present -- zip consumes >9 GB of memory and effectively hangs. `git ls-files` excludes everything `.gitignore` already excludes (node_modules, dist, .borg-data, etc.) with no fnmatch ambiguity, and the `find` line explicitly adds back the three useful gitignored trees: `.git` for commit history, `.design-dump` for design references (if present), `simulator-runs` for sim artifacts.

**INCLUDE** `simulator-runs/`, `.git/`, sim artifacts. GPT runs a sandbox and uses git history + sim outputs. Do not over-exclude. The operator corrected this once already; don't repeat it.

Size will land in the 150-200M range when `simulator-runs/` is populated. Demo-only / code-review zips without sim artifacts land closer to 10-15M.

### 2. Attach via the sway MCP

- Focus chromium: `swaymsg [app_id=chromium] focus`
- Click "+" attach button at bottom-left of the input. Coords drift, so always take a screenshot first and verify with `mark_x`/`mark_y` before clicking.
- Menu opens → click "Add photos & files"
- File picker opens with `~` as cwd → `~/borgvN.zip` is usually at the top (most recent)
- Click "Open"
- Wait briefly for the upload (the chip becomes solid, no spinner)

### 3. Paste the questions

ChatGPT will auto-attach any large paste as a separate document. We want it as the message text. Two options:

- Paste, then click "Show in text field" on the auto-attachment chip. Easiest.
- Or load to clipboard from bash (`wl-copy < ~/borg-vN-review-questions.md`) then ctrl+v in the focused composer.

### 4. Submit

Send button is the up-arrow at bottom-right. Click it. Composer changes to "Follow up" + stop button appears. Scroll the chat down to confirm the user message is visible and "Pro thinking" indicator is up.

### 5. Poll

GPT Pro Extended usually finishes in 20-40 min, sometimes 2-3 hours. Use a backgrounded sleep + bash:

```bash
sleep 1500; date  # 25 min, run_in_background=true
```

The harness notifies you when the sleep ends. Take a screenshot, check for the stop button (still thinking) vs the response actually rendered. If still thinking, schedule another 15-20 min and repeat. If 3+ hours with no progress, flag the operator.

### 6. Ingest the response

When done, scroll to the response, find the action buttons at the very bottom (the two-squares "copy markdown" button is leftmost). Click it. Then:

```bash
wl-paste > ~/review.md
```

That's your input for the next cross-verification cycle.

---

## Sim run mechanics

Family + compaction in parallel is the standard validation pair:

```bash
cd "$REPO_ROOT"
pnpm simulate --scenario family-aging-parent --prefix vN.1 &
pnpm simulate --scenario shared-state-compaction --prefix vN.1 &
wait
```

Set `REPO_ROOT` to the worktree or checkout you are validating. Check
`simulator/cli.ts` and `package.json` if simulator flags move.

Sims write to `simulator-runs/` with the prefix. The overseer audit jsonl and the report.md are the most-useful artifacts for the review draft.

### LM Studio outages

LM Studio at `localhost:1234` provides embeddings. If the operator restarts it mid-sim, you'll see one or more `borg_hard_aborted_turn` events with ECONNREFUSED in logs. The aborted_turn mechanism (Sprint 6d-7) absorbs single outages; the sim continues. If 5+ consecutive turns fail, compaction will abort itself. Stop the sim, wait for the operator's all-clear, relaunch.

### Host switch

If the operator has been working on a different machine, the repo on ivory may be behind. Always check `git log --oneline -5` at the start of a session against what you expect. If commits you wrote in a previous session are missing, do `git pull --ff-only` before doing anything else. The operator caught this once; saved a wasted sprint.

---

## File conventions

- `~/review.md` -- latest GPT Pro response (overwritten each cycle)
- `~/borg-v[N]-review-questions.md` -- questions document drafted for cycle N
- `~/borgv[N].zip` -- artifact uploaded to GPT
- `simulator-runs/v[N].M-<scenario>-*` -- sim artifacts, keep across cycles for comparison

---

## What "done" looks like

The codebase the operator wants to look at and find:

0. **The memory-architecture inversion is complete** -- the entity's internal recall is global (never audience/session-gated for cognition); audience, session, role, and privacy are disclosure metadata and action-policy inputs only; and privacy is enforced as a post-recall disclosure judgment, not by hiding memories from the entity. The human-mind invariant tests pass. **Until this holds, the project is NOT done no matter how favorable the GPT review tone.** See the Cardinal Memory Rule in CLAUDE.md and BOUNDARIES.md. The criteria below are subordinate to this gate.
1. Works well across diverse scenarios (group chat, single-user dev, relationships, etc.).
2. Clean, not overengineered, no duplication, well organized.
3. Each mechanism justified by something concrete it prevents or enables.

Subordinate to criterion #0: when you've done a cycle where the GPT review is mostly "looks good, here are some forward-looking ideas" rather than "fix this", you're close on the quality axis. Run one more cycle to be sure, then -- only if the inversion in #0 also holds -- propose stopping.
